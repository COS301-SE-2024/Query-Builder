# Query Builder
Once a database has been selected to be queried and a successful connection has been established, you will be able to query the database using either a ***form*** or ***drag and drop*** system.

## Form Manipulation
### Selecting schema
![query-builder-user-guide-1](./../../static/img/query-builder-user-guide-1.png)  

When the form initially loads, you will be asked to enter in the Schema you would like to query. This is necessary as some databases host multiple schemas.
You will be able to change the schema by clicking 'Select Database'.

### Selecting Table

After a schema has been selected, you can select the table that you want to create your query for. This is done in the same manner as in the previous step, but instead of clicking 'Select Database', you will instead click 'Select Table'.

### Selecting Columns

Now you are able to select all of the columns you would like to query. This differs slightly from the previous steps as you are able to select multiple columns. This can be initiated by clicking 'No columns selected, will default to all columns selected'.  
You can select or deselect all columns by clicking the 'Select All' option.

You are now ready to query by clicking the 'Query' button.

## Drag and Drop Manipulation
This is not implemented yet, but as we implement, this will be updated...
