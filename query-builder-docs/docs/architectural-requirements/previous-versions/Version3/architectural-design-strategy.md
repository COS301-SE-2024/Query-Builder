# Architectural Design Strategy

_We will be using design based on quality requirements as our strategy for designing architecture for our system._

By prioritizing critical aspects such as performance, security, scalability, maintainability, and usability, we're laying a solid foundation for the system's development. This approach allows us to make informed trade-offs and decisions throughout the design process, ensuring that the final architecture effectively balances competing quality attributes. Moreover, the iterative nature of this approach enables continuous refinement and adaptation to changing requirements, emerging technologies, and new insights. Overall, by prioritizing quality requirements in our architectural design strategy, we're not only meeting the client's expectations but also delivering a robust, high-quality system that stands the test of time.
