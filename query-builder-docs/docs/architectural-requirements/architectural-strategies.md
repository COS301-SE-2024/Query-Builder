# Architectural Strategies/Tactics

## Usability

**Consistent Navigation:** Ensure consistent navigation throughout the application to reduce cognitive load and improve user understanding.

**Progressive Disclosure:** Present information and features gradually, revealing complexity as users become more familiar with the application, thus reducing overwhelm for new users.

## Security

**Role based security:** Restrict access to system resources based on roles assigned to individual users, ensuring that users only have access to the information and functionality relevant to their role.

**Fail securely:** Implement measures to handle failures gracefully, ensuring that even in the event of a security breach or system failure, sensitive information is protected and the system remains secure.

**Authentication:** Verify the identity of users accessing the system, typically through methods such as passwords, biometrics, or multi-factor authentication, to prevent unauthorized access and protect sensitive data.

## Scalability

**Increase processing power:** Scale the system by adding more processing power, such as upgrading hardware or utilizing cloud-based services with higher computing capacity, to handle increased workload and user demands.

**Spread load across time:** Distribute workload evenly over time by scheduling tasks during off-peak hours or implementing mechanisms to queue requests during peak periods, ensuring consistent performance and preventing overload on the system.

## Performance

**Caching:** Store frequently accessed data in a cache to reduce the need for repeated processing and improve response times, particularly for read-heavy applications.

**Efficient storage usage:** Optimize storage usage by compressing data, removing redundant information, and implementing efficient data structures, reducing storage costs and improving performance.

**Pre-processing:** Perform computationally intensive tasks or data transformations in advance, storing the results for future use, to reduce processing time and improve overall system performance.

## Reliability

**Redundancy:** Improve reliability by deploying redundant components and failover mechanisms, ensuring that the system can continue operating even in the event of hardware failures or other disruptions.

**Checkpoint rollback:** Implement mechanisms to roll back to a previous stable state in case of errors or failures, allowing the system to recover quickly and minimize downtime.

**Maintain backups:** Regularly backup system data and configuration settings to external storage or remote servers, ensuring that critical information can be restored in the event of data loss, corruption, or system failure.
