# Technology Requirements

## Frontend 

*In this subsection we will explain what we will be using for the frontend of our system*

- NextJS

We will be using NextJS for our frontend due to its powerful features that enhance both the development process and the performance of our web application. NextJS provides hybrid static and server-side rendering capabilities, allowing us to optimize load times and ensure our content is up-to-date and SEO-friendly. Its Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) feature enables us to update static content without a full rebuild, striking a perfect balance between static and dynamic content. 

## Backend

*In this subsection we will explain what we will be using for the backend of our system*

- NestJS

NestJS is a progressive NodeJS framework designed for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications. It leverages TypeScript and incorporates principles from object-oriented programming (OOP), functional programming (FP), and reactive programming, making it a versatile and modern solution for backend development. With a modular architecture, NestJS allows for easy code organization and reusability.

## User Auth

*In thus subsection we explain what we will be using for user management*

- Supabase

We will be using Supabase for all our user authentication, authorization, and user management. This choice ensures the highest quality of security for users when logging in and provides us with the flexibility to implement extensive functionality regarding user management without having to build it from scratch. Supabase offers a powerful and secure backend-as-a-service platform that integrates seamlessly with our application, simplifying the development process while maintaining robust security and performance standards.
