# Constraints

*The client laid out the following constraints, by which QBEE has to abide, in their specification.*

## User Privacy and Data Security

*QBEE should adhere to legal standards and best practices in data protection.*

QBEE will use stringent authentication and authorisation mechanisms to ensure that users' data, in both their own databases, as well as the data that they share with QBEE, is kept private and not shared with other users or the general public without their consent. This will also ensure conformity with legal standards such as South Africa's Protection of Personal Information Act.

## Balancing Simplicity and Functionality

*QBEE should maintain a user-friendly interface without compromising on advanced features.*

QBEE will provide user-friendly interfaces, such as drag-and-drop flowcharts and a form, to allow non-technical users to easily construct queries for their databases. At the same time, the system should be powerful enough to construct almost any sort of data-viewing query, provided the user has authorisation to access the data.
