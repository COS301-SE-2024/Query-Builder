## Project Introduction
<div align='left'>

QBee is an innovative solution that transforms how users interact with databases, regardless of their technical skill level. By replacing traditional query methods with an intuitive drag-and-drop GUI, QBee makes database manipulation effortless and enables real-time query collaboration. 
It ensures robust data privacy and integrity, providing a secure environment for users.

Beyond basic query building, QBee offers tools to convert databases between formats and visualize data through generated graphs, facilitating deeper insights, enhancing user experience and efficiency.

QBee is the ultimate tool for modern database management and analysis.

    <p>
       I am currently in my final year of BSc Computer Science. My passions range from figuring out new and interesting concepts in the world of tech to baking pastries and cakes in my free time; so I definitely know how to manage my time. Most importantly, I like to challenge myself. Most vacations, I work for BBD Software on vacation projects. I particularly enjoy designing front-ends and using better technologies and innovations to have a better user and developer experience, like implementing Module Federation for front-end designs. I also enjoy Data Analytics and curious to understand how it will influence data predictions and projections, for Machine Learning purposes.
