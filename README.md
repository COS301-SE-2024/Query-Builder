## Project Introduction
<div align='left'>

QBee is an innovative solution that transforms how users interact with databases, regardless of their technical skill level. By replacing traditional query methods with a user-friendly form interface, as well as natural language querying, QBee makes database querying effortless. 
It ensures robust data privacy and integrity, providing a secure environment for users.

Beyond basic query building, QBee offers tools to visualize data through generated graphs, facilitating deeper insights and enhancing user experience and efficiency.

QBee is the ultimate tool for modern database management and analysis.

    <p>
       I am currently in my final year of BSc Computer Science. My passions range from figuring out new and interesting concepts in the world of tech to baking pastries and cakes in my free time; so I definitely know how to manage my time. Most importantly, I like to challenge myself. Most vacations, I work for BBD Software on vacation projects. I particularly enjoy designing front-ends and using better technologies and innovations to have a better user and developer experience, like implementing Module Federation for front-end designs. I also enjoy Data Analytics and curious to understand how it will influence data predictions and projections, for Machine Learning purposes.

## Running the App
The application is available at our website, however, if you want to host it youself, there are two ways.
> **Note:** In both cases, a .env file is needed for the backend and a .env.production is necessary on the frontend when running with Docker, or a .env.local file is needed when running from source.
> A Supabase project is also necessary. If you have any queries, contact us at ctrlaltelitesdevs@gmail.com

Initially, run the following command to clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/COS301-SE-2024/Query-Builder.git
```

### Running with Docker
This is the recommended way to run the application.

From the base directory, run the following:
```shell
docker compose up --detach
```

The Next.js application can then be accessed at [localhost:3000] and the NestJS backend can be accessed at [localhost:3001].

### Running from source

> **Note:** You will have to host a redis server, this can be done by running `sudo apt install redis-server`, assuming you are using a debian based system. To run the server, run `redis-server`.

Install dependencies
```shell
cd query-builder-app
pnpm i
cd ../query-builder-backend
pnpm i
```

Run the app locally (run the following command within the query-builder-app directory)
1. Build the app - this only has to be done once.
```shell
pnpm build
```
2. Start the app - this can be rerun multiple times
```shell
pnpm start
```

Run the backend locally (run the following command within the query-builder-backend directory)
1. Build the backend - this only has to be done once.
```shell
pnpm build
```
2. Start the backend - this can be rerun multiple times
```shell
pnpm start
```

> **Note:** This is necessary for the frontend to work and should be done in a separate terminal to the frontend

The Next.js application can then be accessed at [localhost:3000] and the NestJS backend can be accessed at [localhost:55555].
